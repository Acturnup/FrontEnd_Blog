## Project 1 ##

# Milestone 1 

 1. Overall description of the project:
    -*The topic/purpose of the website:* The purpose of this website is to help students be more engaged with events and 
                                      be more compelled to use this as a resoruce to find upcoming events in the University area. 
    -Your inspiration for the project: My inspiration of this project is that CU send out emails with very boring and dull information about upcoming events. 
                                      That I feel no one really reads. 
                                      I believe there are so many events that CU provides that, I hope to help users catergozise them and make it easier to read
                                      and find out about them in a apealling way. 
    -The intended audience for your project: 
                                      The audience that I am targeting is University Students.

2. Wireframe that shows the design and flow of your site. This could be anywhere from hand drawn sequence of images to
a low-fidelity mockup in a UX design tool of you choice.

3. Description of how you intend to use JavaScript to significantly enhance the user experience of your website.
    - I intend to create a drop down menu so that people can see a list of options in the category section(professional, self development, social, clubs, sports).
    - Intend to give each a event a organized title and description in a list. 
    - I also intend to create, mapping showing the time, specifc location and date. Allow the user to see the events of that current day.
    - I hope to make the interface easy for the user to use and apealling. 
    - Possibly use a API for map

4. Any content or information sources you intend to draw upon, start thinking about them early and include them in the proposal if possible.

5. Describe or show how you intend to make the website responsive to different screen sizes and environments.

    - I will use a flex box and a nav bar to help create a responsive website that can support Computer Screen, tablets, and phones. 

6.  *Prototyping/proof of concept*
          - should have nav bar (home,category,map)
          - list of events
          - Pages that have a some details for (home, category, map)

            - At least have nav bar that link to pages
            - At least have a drop down menu for categories 
            - At least have a map
            - Events are orgainzed and have details
            - Categorize events
            
    *Stretch goals*
            - Making the interface appealing with a background that moves.
            - A styled page with a nice set of colors. 
            - Making a map that stores certain events with details and can move around. 
            - Allow users to fill out a event that can be created within the website. 
            - Create a button to allow users to see how many people are intrested in a event.
            - Allow users to send feedback about the event
            
            
# Milestone 2 
You should turn in a process blog entry detailing your process on the project up to this point. You should have at least a prototype or a proof of concept for the core functionality of your project.  You should be reflecting on your goals that you laid out in milestone 1, and compare them to the progress that you have made up to this point.
