# Project 1 

# Milestone 1 

<!-- 1. Overall description of the project: -->
    The topic/purpose of the website: The purpose of this website is to help students be more engaged with events and 
                                      be more compelled to use this as a resoruce to find upcoming events in the University area. 
    Your inspiration for the project: My inspiration of this project is that CU send out emails with very boring and dull information about upcoming events. That I feel
                                      no one really reads. 
                                      I believe there are so many events that CU provides that, I hope to help users catergozise them and make it easier to read
                                      and find out about them.
    The intended audience for your project: 
                                      The audience that I am targeting is University Students.
