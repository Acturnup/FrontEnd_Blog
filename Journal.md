# Class portal Milestone 2 


1. Documentation in your process log of the process you went through creating your portal. Describe any problems or roadblocks you encountered and how you resolved them. Talk about any lessons learned of what worked and what you'd do differently next time. And don't forget to link to any out-of-class resources that you used to help create the portal.

I decided to change the format of the page by adding in boxes for each section being the Labs,Projects,Process and Code with a box that links them to a new page.

The problem I had run into was making sure the whole page was filled with a black background without white space. I acheived to fix this by finding online that you can add a height of 100vh being more or less.

Another problem I had having spacing for the boxes on a different size screen they way I acheived to fix this was using flex:column, gap:50px, and using justify content: space-around.

Lastly I wanted to add a list to my Lab page and all the other pages and removed the bullet points, I found how to remove with some research where I added list-style:none
