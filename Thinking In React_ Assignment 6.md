## Plan To-do-list ##


1. 	<sub> Break the UI into a component heirarchy: </sub> break down the mock-up that you created into a list of components and describe how you anticipate each component to interact together.

3 and 4. Identify the minimal state representation of your app and identify where state should live: identify where you might need to keep state of something; in which component will it be stored, and how will it be accessed? Try to not repeat data in multiple places, and keep the state representation as minimal as possible.
