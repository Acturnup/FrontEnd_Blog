## Plan To-do-list ##


1. Break the UI into a component heirarchy:  
<sub> break down the mock-up that you created into a list of components and describe how you anticipate each component to interact together. </sub>

 {category: "High Priority", finished: true, task: "Make a reservation to Japango"},
 
 {category: "High Priority", finished: false, task: "Do Front end homework"},



3 and 4. Identify the minimal state representation of your app and identify where state should live:
<sub>identify where you might need to keep state of something; in which component will it be stored, and how will it be accessed? Try to not repeat data in multiple places, and keep the state representation as minimal as possible. </sub>
