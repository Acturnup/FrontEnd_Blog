Describe what you anticipate your personal contributions to the team and the project will be in the end.
Your goals for the project should be split up by what you think are goals for:



      Prototyping/proof of concept
        - Prototyped out in figma to ensure we are both on the same page as far as the content we want on the site.
        - Selecting a appropriate color palate 
      MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
        - At Least 10 recipes to choose from and search from.
        - Hover effect on these as images in a gallery so that we are able to have the user hover and then see more. Then they would click to view the entire recipe.
        - Finding the recipes and displaying them in a unique fashion
      Stretch goals
        - Utilize data to have/load more recipes.
        - Utilize an API to get access to even more recipes
        - Utilize a database to store the user's review of a recipe they have tried.
        - Creating a search bar
        - Generator for Recipes
        - New day, new recipe with the date displayed at the top right
