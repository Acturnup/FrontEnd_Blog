# FrontEnd_Blog
Blog

# A paragraph or more in your process blog, describing the overall concept/theme of your planned portal.



 # A wireframe or visual mockup of the intended user interface design.



# The design must accommodate all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop. You can either visually indicate this in the mockup (make it clear to me), or you can describe it in words in your process blog.



# The architecture and user interaction flow must also be clearly communicated either through words or visually through the wireframe/mockup.



# The submission for milestone 1 is a link to your process blog entry specifically for "Class Portal, Milestone 1."
